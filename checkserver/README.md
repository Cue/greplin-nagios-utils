greplin-nagios-utils: checkserver
=================================

Simple server that runs checks.
-------------------------------

checkserver loads checks located at

    /usr/lib/nagios/check_<name>.py

when you visit

    http://localhost:8111/check/<name>

When the check changes, you can reload the changed code by visiting

    http://localhost:8111/update/<name>

That's it!  We also include check.sh which returns the proper exit code from a check.

Using checkserver is simple, run an instance of the server, and then add nagios checks like:

	define command {
	    command_name    check_<name>
	    command_line    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check.sh <name> args like $HOSTNAME$
	}

	define service {
	    use                     your-service-type
	    service_description     Your Description Here
	    check_command           check_<name>
	    hostgroup_name          your-hostgroup
	}
